# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

The large corporation, Pewlett-Hackard requisitioned us to find relevant information concerning the upcoming "gray wave" which represents an aging workforce and a potentially destructive retirement wave which could disrupt the firm's overall producivity, training/mentorship and overall profitability. For the following task, we built upon five excel files to build multiple tables to ultimately come to representative and accurate numbers on what the firm needs to know in order to be prepared for the upcoming and inevitable "Gray Retirment Wave."
First requirement is to solve the amount of employees who are retiring and this amounts to 65,427 employees. 
Second requiremnt is the individuals available for mentorships and this amounts to .... employees
For further information, I would recommend a slotting into which roles are inadequatley filled in order to ensure there isn't any missed opportunity to train the next generation. This could be solved by having a column with the role of the individual, count that total and compare versus and age group that is not retiring. This could visualize the wave and how to fill the gap in a potential brain drain.
